**What is Diffusion transformer:** 
The **Diffusion Transformer (DiT)** is a transformer-based architecture that replaces convolutional networks in diffusion models. It was introduced in “DiT: Self-Attention Diffusion
Models” (by Peebles and Xie, 2022) as a way to scale diffusion models using the transformer’s self-attention mechanism.

Core Idea:
Traditional Diffusion Models (like DDPM) use UNets with CNNs to denoise images during the reverse diffusion process.
The Diffusion Transformer replaces the CNN-based UNet with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone.
It uses positional embeddings, conditioning (e.g., class labels), and time-step embeddings as part of the input.

Advantages:
Scales better than CNNs at larger sizes
Beneficial for long-range interactions in high-resolution images
Easily integrates into transformer ecosystems

Future Outlook (Speculative):
Transformers like DiT are expected to dominate large-scale generative modeling, especially in multimodal applications (e.g., text-to-image, video diffusion), due to their scalability and parallelism.

Model used : PixArt-α   
PixArt-α is a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), and the training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PixArt-α only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days).
